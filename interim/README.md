# Interim Report

## Progress
### Rosie Clifton (rc859) 
- 

### Bangyi Gao (bg432)
- 

### Zi Cai (zc348)
- Fully comprehended IMMI's prediction algorithm
- Reimplemented the algorithm in Python. This allows for insights into the theory behind the code and forces one to consider all possible deviations during usage
- Research into alternative prediction algorithms (time series e.g. ARMA and ML e.g. CNN)

## Issues and Solutions


## Individual Development
- Improved collaboration skills.
  - Repository management, code merging and formatting for easier maintenance.
  - Better understanding of how individual strengths can be paired with tasks.
- Time management
  - Include delays and rework into planning (e.g. IMMI does not respond immediately).
  - Identify tasks that can be completed in parallel.
  - Prioritize tasks that are associated with primary objectives and wider impact.

### Rosie Clifton (rc859) 
- 

### Bangyi Gao (bg432)
- 

### Zi Cai (zc348)
- Learned dart basics.
- Learned Excel macros/VBA in order to use and understand IMMI's code.
- More insights into coding from a userâ€™s perspective and how to consider all deviations.
