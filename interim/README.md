# Interim Report

## Completed and Remaining Objectives
- Cycle prediction based on user input​ (60% completed)
- Prediction visualization on a calendar​ (not started)
- Syncing with the local calendar​ (not started)
- Local data storage (a bit stuck)
- User customization of the webpage and calendar in terms of appearance, notes, emojis, etc (80% completed)
*updated proposal.md and management.md to reflect presentation feedback

##  Individual Progress
### Rosie Clifton (rc859) 
- Design a visually accessible information page.
- Research on how to store data locally。
- Started looking into using similar design techniques for the data and diary page.

### Bangyi Gao (bg432)
- Develop the software framework
- Set template for Home, Diary, and Setting Page
- Research on GPT Prompting <br />
https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/cot#zero-shot-cot-prompting <br />
https://www.ibm.com/topics/ai-hallucinations
- Started looking into how to sync local data with the calendar


### Zi Cai (zc348)
- Fully comprehended IMMI's prediction algorithm
- Reimplemented the algorithm in Python. This allows for insights into the theory behind the code and forces one to consider all possible deviations during usage
- Research into alternative prediction algorithms (e.g. ARMA, LSTM) <br />

## Issues and Steps to Solution
Prediction algorithm development
1. Research into popular algorithms -> hard to implement in a short time frame
2. Develop a basic time series predictor -> time-consuming
3. Building based on IMMI’s work instead of reinventing the wheel, reimplementation in a familiar language -> better code understanding and easier domain transfer

Framework Development
1. Develop an accessible software platform -> Need for a multi-platform development tool
2. Look into software development platform -> hard to learn within a limited timeframe
3. Develop the software framework in Flutter, which is accessible on all platforms, with GPT Copilot -> Simplifies the initial development and later implementation

Software design
1. Look into different design methods including making the web pages scrollable -> time-consuming
2. Develop accessible and informative web pages -> time-consuming
3. Lots of helpful websites and YouTube videos explaining how to implement these methods into the web design -> better understanding of the flutter code helping when looking at the other pages

## Individual Development
- Improved collaboration skills.
  - Repository management, code merging and formatting for easier maintenance, and keeping commits frequent and documented in case of error. 
  - Better understanding of how individual strengths can be paired with tasks.
- Time management
  - Include delays and rework into planning (e.g. IMMI does not respond immediately).
  - Identify tasks that can be completed in parallel.
  - Prioritize tasks that are associated with primary objectives and wider impact.

### Rosie Clifton (rc859) 
- Learned dart.
- Learned how to better collaborate using git.
- Learned more software design techniques.

### Bangyi Gao (bg432)
- Learned dart.
- Learned better prompting with LLM.
- More insights into UI design to enhance user comfort while using the app.

### Zi Cai (zc348)
- Learned dart basics.
- Learned Excel macros/VBA in order to use and understand IMMI's code.
- More insights into coding from a user’s perspective and how to consider all deviations.
