# Interim Report

## Completed and Remaining Objectives
- Cycle prediction based on user input​ (60% completed)
- Prediction visualization on a calendar​ (not started)
- Syncing with the local calendar​ (not started)
- Local data storage (a bit stuck)
- User customization of the webpage and calendar in terms of appearance, notes, emojis, etc (80% completed)
*updated proposal.md and management.md to reflect presentation feedbacks

##  Individual Progress
### Rosie Clifton (rc859) 
- Design a visually accessible information page.
- Research on how to store data locally。
- Started looking into using similar design techniques for the data and diary page.

### Bangyi Gao (bg432)
- Develop the software framework with 5 subpages.
- Research on GPT prompting for more efficient software development.
- Started to looking into how to sync and visualize local data on the calendar.

### Zi Cai (zc348)
- Fully comprehended IMMI's prediction algorithm
- Reimplemented the algorithm in Python. This allows for insights into the theory behind the code and forces one to consider all possible deviations during usage
- Research into alternative prediction algorithms (time series e.g. ARMA and ML e.g. CNN)

## Issues and Steps to Solution
Prediction algorithm development
1. Research into popular algorithms -> hard to implement in a short time frame
2. Develop a basic time series predictor -> time-consuming
3. Building based on IMMI’s work instead of reinventing the wheel, reimplementation in a familiar language -> better code understanding and easier domain transfer

## Individual Development
- Improved collaboration skills.
  - Repository management, code merging and formatting for easier maintenance, and keeping commits frequent and documented in case of error. 
  - Better understanding of how individual strengths can be paired with tasks.
- Time management
  - Include delays and rework into planning (e.g. IMMI does not respond immediately).
  - Identify tasks that can be completed in parallel.
  - Prioritize tasks that are associated with primary objectives and wider impact.

### Rosie Clifton (rc859) 
- Learned dart.
- Learned how to better collaborate using git.
- Learned more software design techniques.

### Bangyi Gao (bg432)
- 

### Zi Cai (zc348)
- Learned dart basics.
- Learned Excel macros/VBA in order to use and understand IMMI's code.
- More insights into coding from a user’s perspective and how to consider all deviations.
