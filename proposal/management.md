- Weakness: Lack of knowledge in coding with software development.

### Bangyi Gao (bg432)
- Strength: Past experiences in training and implementing AI models, familiar with Python and C++. 
- Weakness: Lack of knowledge in software development and web development.

### Zi Cai (zc348)
- Strength: Past experiences in building and training AI models from scratch, familiar with Python, and experiences in coding collaboratively.
- Weakness: Lack knowledge in software development and UI design.


## The resources needed

- Computers (GPUs are needed if we need to train AI models)
- Algorithms


## The timeline

### First week (May 9 - May 15)
- communicate with Sarah to clarify user demands and schedule periodic meetings for progress checking and ensuring solution meets user demand.
- Form the overall project proposal
  - Problem definition.
  - Objective hierarchy to provide guidance in the order of tackling the problem.
  - Define testible criteria for each objective for verifying that design requirements are met.
  - Reasonable task assignments that utilizes each member's strength.
- Research on data privacy, prediction algorithm, and learning the basics to web-based app development.

### Second week (May 16 - May 22)
#### 

### Third week (May 23 - May 29)
####

### Fourth week (May 30 - May 5)
####

### Final report submission (May 6)
#### 4 PM

## The assessment of the risks and safety

- Electrical (e.g. equipment operating at voltages >1000V, working on exposed circuits with voltages >50v) - NO
- Radiation (e.g. X‐rays, radio‐chemicals) - NO
- Chemical (e.g. harmful, toxic, flammable, sensitizer, carcinogenic etc.) - NO
- Laser (e.g. of class 3B or 4) - NO
- Robotics - NO
- Mechanical (e.g. power tools, workshop machinery, powered lifting etc.) - NO
- Other (e.g. ergonomic for computer work, biological, working at heights, lone working etc.) - YES: low-level risks associated with ergonomics of computer-based work. To be managed by careful initial setup of workstation, taking regular breaks, and avoiding extended working hours


## Contingency plans

Ideally, measures should be taken from the development stage to reduce the likelihood and/or impact of risks, this involves frequent communication to update requirements, app optimization to improve its quality, and more. Nevertheless, contingency plans are also vital to handle the onset of risks.

1. Data Privacy Breach
Risk: User data could be leaked or accessed by unauthorized parties.
Plan: If a data breach occurs, immediately identify the scope of the breach and inform authorities. Conduct a thorough investigation to understand the breach's source, offer compensation to the affected users, and enhance security measures to prevent future breaches.

2. Technical Glitches or Downtime
Risk: The application might face technical issues or downtime.
Plan: In case of downtime, communicate transparently with users about the issue, and provide notices in advance of downtime alongside the expected resolution time.

3. Legal and Compliance Issues
Risk: The application might face legal challenges or fail to comply with regulations due to changes in rules.
Plan: If a legal issue arises, work closely with legal counsel to address it promptly. Communicate transparently with users about any impacts.

4. Project Delays
Risk: The project might not meet its deadlines due to various unforeseen issues.
Plan: If delays occur, reassess the timeline and prioritize essential features. Communicate with stakeholders about revised timelines and progress.

5. Budget Overruns
Risk: The project might exceed its allocated budget.
Plan: If overruns occur, identify non-essential elements that can be scaled back or delayed. Seek additional funding if necessary, with a clear justification.
