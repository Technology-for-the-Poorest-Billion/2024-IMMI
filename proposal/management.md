## The timeline

### First week (May 9 - May 15)
- **Communication:**
  - Communicate with Sarah to clarify user demands.
  - Schedule periodic meetings for progress checking and ensuring the solution meets user demands.
- **Project Proposal:**
  - Form the overall project proposal including:
    - Problem definition.
    - Objective hierarchy to provide guidance in the order of tackling the problem.
    - Define testable criteria for each objective to verify that design requirements are met.
    - Reasonable task assignments that utilize each member's strength.
- **Research:**
  - Research data privacy practices.
  - Investigate prediction algorithms.
  - Learn the basics of web-based app development.

### Second week (May 16 - May 22)
- **Research and Learning:**
  - Continue research on data privacy to identify key practices for securing user data.
  - Investigate suitable prediction algorithms for period cycle prediction.
  - Learn the basics of coding in Flutter, focusing on setting up the development environment.
- **Coding:**
  - Start writing code for the website's main framework and basic navigation.
- **Team Meetings:**
  - Hold a meeting to review progress and address any issues in research or coding.

### Third week (May 23 - May 29)
- **Website Development:**
  - Develop the calendar feature, enabling users to log menstrual cycle data.
  - Implement the prediction algorithm for forecasting future cycles.
  - Ensure user data is stored securely and locally on the device.
- **Interim Presentation:**
  - Prepare and practice the interim presentation to report on the progress and preliminary results.

### Fourth week (May 30 - June 5)
- **Finalizing Features:**
  - Research and begin implementation of syncing data with the local calendar on the user's device.
  - Refine the website to ensure all primary objectives are met.
- **User Feedback:**
  - Conduct a round of user testing to gather feedback on the website’s usability.
  - Make necessary adjustments based on user feedback.
- **Final Preparations:**
  - Prepare the final presentation and compile the final report.

### Final report submission (June 6)
- Submit the final group and individual report by 4 PM.

## The assessment of the risks and safety

- Electrical (e.g. equipment operating at voltages >1000V, working on exposed circuits with voltages >50v) - NO
- Radiation (e.g. X‐rays, radio‐chemicals) - NO
- Chemical (e.g. harmful, toxic, flammable, sensitizer, carcinogenic etc.) - NO
- Laser (e.g. of class 3B or 4) - NO
- Robotics - NO
- Mechanical (e.g. power tools, workshop machinery, powered lifting etc.) - NO
- Other (e.g. ergonomic for computer work, biological, working at heights, lone working etc.) - YES: low-level risks associated with ergonomics of computer-based work. To be managed by careful initial setup of workstation, taking regular breaks, and avoiding extended working hours

## Contingency plans

Ideally, measures should be taken from the development stage to reduce the likelihood and/or impact of risks, this involves frequent communication to update requirements, app optimization to improve its quality, and more. Nevertheless, contingency plans are also vital to handle the onset of risks.

1. Data Privacy Breach
- Risk: User data could be leaked or accessed by unauthorized parties.
- Plan: If a data breach occurs, immediately identify the scope of the breach and inform authorities. Conduct a thorough investigation to understand the breach's source, offer compensation to the affected users, and enhance security measures to prevent future breaches.

2. Technical Glitches or Downtime
- Risk: The application might face technical issues or downtime.
- Plan: In case of downtime, communicate transparently with users about the issue, and provide notices in advance of downtime alongside the expected resolution time.

3. Legal and Compliance Issues
- Risk: The application might face legal challenges or fail to comply with regulations due to changes in rules.
- Plan: If a legal issue arises, work closely with legal counsel to evaluate the nature of the issue, ascertain the extent of impact, and identify means of remediation.

4. Project Delays
- Risk: The project might not meet its deadlines due to unforeseen issues (e.g. rework).
- Plan: If delays occur, reassess the timeline and reprioritize upcoming tasks to guarantee core features. Communicate with the coordinator about revised timelines and progress.

5. Budget Overruns
- Risk: The project might exceed its allocated budget.
- Plan: If overruns occur, identify the reason behind the overrun and discover non-essential elements that can be scaled back or delayed. Seek additional funding if necessary, with a clear justification.
