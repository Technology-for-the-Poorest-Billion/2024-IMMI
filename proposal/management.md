- Algorithms


## The timeline

### First week (May 9 - May 15)
- communicate with Sarah to clarify user demands and schedule periodic meetings for progress checking and ensuring solution meets user demand.
- Form the overall project proposal
  - Problem definition.
  - Objective hierarchy to provide guidance in the order of tackling the problem.
  - Define testible criteria for each objective for verifying that design requirements are met.
  - Reasonable task assignments that utilizes each member's strength.
- Research on data privacy, prediction algorithm, and learning the basics to web-based app development.

### Second week (May 16 - May 22)
#### 

### Third week (May 23 - May 29)
####

### Fourth week (May 30 - May 5)
####

### Final report submission (May 6)
#### 4 PM

## The assessment of the risks and safety

- Electrical (e.g. equipment operating at voltages >1000V, working on exposed circuits with voltages >50v) - NO
- Radiation (e.g. X‐rays, radio‐chemicals) - NO
- Chemical (e.g. harmful, toxic, flammable, sensitizer, carcinogenic etc.) - NO
- Laser (e.g. of class 3B or 4) - NO
- Robotics - NO
- Mechanical (e.g. power tools, workshop machinery, powered lifting etc.) - NO
- Other (e.g. ergonomic for computer work, biological, working at heights, lone working etc.) - YES: low-level risks associated with ergonomics of computer-based work. To be managed by careful initial setup of workstation, taking regular breaks, and avoiding extended working hours


## Contingency plans

Ideally, measures should be taken from the development stage to 

1. Data Privacy Breach
Risk: User data could be leaked or accessed by unauthorized parties.
Prevention: Implement strong data encryption methods both in transit and at rest. Use secure protocols like HTTPS.
Mitigation: Regularly audit and update security measures. Employ a dedicated security team to monitor and respond to threats.
Response: If a data breach occurs, immediately inform affected users and authorities. Conduct a thorough investigation to understand the breach's source, and enhance security measures to prevent future breaches.

2. Technical Glitches or Downtime
Risk: The application might face technical issues or downtime.
Prevention: Use robust cloud services with high uptime guarantees. Implement load balancing and regular maintenance checks.
Mitigation: Develop a comprehensive backup and disaster recovery plan. Ensure data backups are taken regularly and stored securely.
Response: In case of downtime, communicate transparently with users about the issue and expected resolution time. Provide alternative methods for users to access critical features temporarily.

3. User Adoption Issues
Risk: Users might find the application difficult to use or not engaging enough.
Prevention: Conduct thorough user research and usability testing during development. Involve potential users in the design process.
Mitigation: Offer detailed tutorials and customer support. Continuously collect user feedback and iterate on the design.
Response: If user adoption is low, analyze feedback to identify pain points. Implement changes based on user suggestions and relaunch marketing efforts to attract users.

4. Legal and Compliance Issues
Risk: The application might face legal challenges or fail to comply with regulations.
Prevention: Ensure the app complies with all relevant laws and regulations, such as GDPR or HIPAA, from the outset. Consult with legal experts regularly.
Mitigation: Stay updated with changing laws and regulations to ensure ongoing compliance. Conduct regular compliance audits.
Response: If a legal issue arises, work closely with legal counsel to address it promptly. Communicate transparently with users about any impacts.

5. Project Delays
Risk: The project might not meet its deadlines due to various unforeseen issues.
Prevention: Develop a detailed project timeline with buffer periods for potential delays. Assign clear responsibilities and maintain regular check-ins.
Mitigation: Identify critical path tasks and monitor them closely. Be flexible in reassigning resources if necessary to meet deadlines.
Response: If delays occur, reassess the timeline and prioritize essential features. Communicate with stakeholders about revised timelines and progress.

6. Budget Overruns
Risk: The project might exceed its allocated budget.
Prevention: Create a detailed budget plan with contingencies for unexpected expenses. Monitor expenditures closely.
Mitigation: Regularly review the budget and adjust allocations as needed. Look for cost-saving opportunities without compromising quality.
Response: If overruns occur, identify non-essential elements that can be scaled back or delayed. Seek additional funding if necessary, with a clear justification.

7. Team Collaboration Issues
Risk: The team might face communication or collaboration issues, leading to inefficiencies.
Prevention: Establish clear communication channels and collaborative tools. Promote a culture of openness and regular feedback.
Mitigation: Conduct regular team meetings to ensure alignment. Provide training on collaboration tools and practices.
Response: If issues arise, hold mediation sessions to resolve conflicts. Reorganize team roles if needed to improve efficiency.
