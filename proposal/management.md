# Project management plan


## The people

### Rosie Clifton (rc859) 
- Strength: Past experience on the design part of website development.
- Weakness: Lack of knowledge in coding with software development.

### Bangyi Gao (bg432)
- Strength: Past experiences in training and implementing AI models, familiar with Python and C++. 
- Weakness: Lack of knowledge in software development and web development.

### Zi Cai (zc348)
- Strength: Past experiences in building and training AI models from scratch, familiar with Python, and experiences in coding collaboratively.
- Weakness: Lack knowledge in software development and UI design.


## The resources needed

- Computers (GPUs are needed if we need to train AI models)
- Algorithms


## The timeline

### First week (May 9 - May 15)
- communicate with Sarah to clarify user demands and schedule periodic meetings for progress checking and ensuring solution meets user demand.
- Form the overall project proposal
  - Problem definition.
  - Objective hierarchy to provide guidance in the order of tackling the problem.
  - Define testible criteria for each objective for verifying that design requirements are met.
  - Reasonable task assignments that utilizes each member's strength.
- Research on data privacy, prediction algorithm, and learning the basics to web-based app development.

### Second week (May 16 - May 22)
#### 

### Third week (May 23 - May 29)
####

### Fourth week (May 30 - May 5)
####

### Final report submission (May 6)
#### 4 PM

## The assessment of the risks and safety

- Electrical (e.g. equipment operating at voltages >1000V, working on exposed circuits with voltages >50v) - NO
- Radiation (e.g. X‐rays, radio‐chemicals) - NO
- Chemical (e.g. harmful, toxic, flammable, sensitizer, carcinogenic etc.) - NO
- Laser (e.g. of class 3B or 4) - NO
- Robotics - NO
- Mechanical (e.g. power tools, workshop machinery, powered lifting etc.) - NO
- Other (e.g. ergonomic for computer work, biological, working at heights, lone working etc.) - YES: low-level risks associated with ergonomics of computer-based work. To be managed by careful initial setup of workstation, taking regular breaks, and avoiding extended working hours


## Contingency plans

#### Leaked data: take measures to prevent the data from leaking again. For example, we can implement stronger data encryption methods.
#### Ethical concerns: ensure the AI algorithms are trained ethically and responsibly. For example, while developing AI models, we must be aware of AI ethics such as security and privacy.
