# Problem description
The issue of low awareness of the menstrual cycle persists despite the increasing economy, statistics have shown that 40% of the girls in the US felt "confused and unprepared" for their first period, this problem is more prominent in developing countries. Current methods for raising awareness and/or providing assistance such as cycle tracking apps have exhibited negligence toward data privacy exacerbating the issue despite 79% of women showing concerns. It is therefore vital and urgent to develop means of remediation.

## Problem Statement

*Develop a tool that raises girls' awareness of their bodies, periods, and fertility with the concern to ensure data privacy and allow users to customise the tool.*


# Presentation of the proposal

We propose an accessible web-based application centring around an online calendar that visualizes past and predicted periods, the application has the following main functions which are our primary objectives for these 4 weeks:
1. Cycle prediction based on user input.
2. Prediction visualization on a calendar.
3. Syncs with local calender.
4. User customizations of the webpage and calendar in terms of appearance, notes, emojis, etc.

In addition to the aforementioned requirements, the objectives below will be experimented if the main functions are fulfilled:
1. AI prediction algorithm that interprets user inputs (notes, emojis, moods).
2. AI recommendation algorithm that gives suggestions on diet and fitness if enabled.
3. An efficient compression scheme to reduce local memory requirements.
4. Data encryption to ensure locally stored information is secure in the event of leakage.
