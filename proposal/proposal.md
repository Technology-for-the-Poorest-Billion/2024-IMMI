# Problem Description
The issue of low awareness of the menstrual cycle persists despite the increasing economy, statistics have shown that 40% of the girls in the US felt "confused and unprepared" for their first period, this problem is more prominent in developing countries. Current methods for raising awareness and/or providing assistance such as cycle tracking apps have exhibited negligence toward data privacy exacerbating the issue despite 79% of women showing concerns. It is therefore vital and urgent to develop means of remediation.

## Problem Statement

*Develop a tool that raises girls' awareness of their bodies, periods, and fertility with the concern to ensure data privacy and allow users to customize the tool.*

# Presentation of the proposal

We propose an accessible web-based application centering around an online calendar that visualizes past and predicted periods, the application has the following main functions which are our primary objectives for these 4 weeks:
1. Cycle prediction based on user input.
2. Prediction visualization on a calendar.
3. Syncs with local calender.
4. Local data storage.
5. User customizations of the webpage and calendar in terms of appearance, notes, emojis, etc.

In addition to the aforementioned requirements, the objectives below will be experimented if the main functions are fulfilled:
1. AI prediction algorithm that interprets user inputs (notes, emojis, moods).
2. AI recommendation algorithm that gives suggestions on diet and fitness if enabled.
3. An efficient compression scheme to reduce local memory requirements.
4. Data encryption to ensure locally stored information is secure in the event of leakage.


# Assessment of the quality of the proposal
1. Responsible
  - Secure data storage
  - Accurate tracking enabling dependency
2. Responds to a genuine need
  - Better (more secure and personalized) product in the existing market
3. Adds significant value
  - Conserves effort and time in cycle tracking; prevents anxiety and emotional issues by spreading awareness
4. Accessible to end-users
  - Software accessible from multiple operating systems and in hardware form
5. Context-appropriate
  - User customisable
  - Interoperable with cell phones and smartwatches

## Methods of Assessment
Verifying the successful implementation of functions (including safety concerns)
- Include testable and trackable criteria for each function.
- Performing simulations and unit tests to ensure our app handles both normal and extreme cases of use (e.g. data surge).
- Enlist external experts to challenge our plan for data privacy

Validating that user demands are met 
- Enabling user feedback on the app and conducting interviews after using it for some time
- Involve users when the requirements for the solution are being defined
- Timely communication with concerned parties to prevent deviations.
