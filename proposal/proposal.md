# Problem description
## test


Develop a tool that educate girls about their bodies, the periods, and fertility. It also needs to ensure data privacy, and allow user to make the tool personal.

# Presentation of the proposal

We propose a web-based app centering around an online calender that visualizes past and predicted periods, the app has the following main functions which are our primary objectives for these 4 weeks:
1. Cycle prediction based on user input.
2. Prediction visualization on a calender.
3. Syncs with local calender.
4. User customizations of the webpage and calender in terms of appearance, notes, emojis, etc.

In addition to the aforementioned requirements, the objectives below will be experimented if the main functions are fulfilled:
1. AI prediction algorithm that interprets user inputs (notes, emojis, moods).
2. AI recommendation algorithm that gives suggestions on diet and fitness if enabled.
3. An efficient compression scheme to reduce local memory requirements.
4. Data encryption to ensure locally stored information is secure in the event of leakage.
