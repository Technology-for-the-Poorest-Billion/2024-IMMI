### Teamwork Strategy
1. **Ensure Communication**: Establish clear and consistent communication channels to facilitate information sharing and collaboration.
2. **Regular Meetings**: Schedule frequent meetings to discuss progress, address issues, and make decisions collectively.
3. **Effective Time Management and Planning**: Assign specific tasks to team members according to their strengths and ensure tasks are completed at different stages to maintain workflow.
4. **Seek Help When Necessary**: Encourage team members to seek assistance when encountering difficulties, fostering a supportive environment.

Most planned milestones were achieved as outlined in the plan. We completed 4 out of 5 main objectives, with the third objective left for future work.

1. **Cycle Prediction Based on User Input**
2. **Prediction Visualization on a Calendar**
3. **Syncing with Local Calendar** *(Future Work)*
4. **Local Data Storage**
5. **User Customization of the Webpage and Calendar** (appearance, notes, emojis, etc.)

### What Worked
- **Clear Role Assignments**: Each team member was responsible for specific tasks, ensuring a balanced distribution of work.
- **Successful Integration**: We effectively integrated the contributions of all team members, resulting in a cohesive final product.

### What Didn't Work
- **Technical Difficulties**: We underestimated the complexity of syncing with the local calendar, making this task incomplete. However, this can be addressed in future work since we have established the local data storage. 

### Constructive Recommendations
1. **Maintain Time Management and Update Plans**: Regularly update the project plan to reflect current progress and ensure timely completion of tasks.
2. **Foster Good Communication**: Continue to promote open and effective communication among team members to address issues promptly.
3. **Avoid Last-Minute Rush**: Aim to complete tasks ahead of the deadline to allow time for unforeseen challenges.
4. **Reassess and Reprioritize**: If delays occur, reassess the timeline and prioritize tasks to ensure that core features are completed on time.
