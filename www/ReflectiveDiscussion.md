title: Alignment with Sustainable Development Goals
---

🌏 UNICEF has proposed 17 sustainable development goals that aim to avoid depleting resources at the expense of economic growth. Being at a junction of development when extreme weather is becoming more frequent and conflicts more intense, engineers must use these goals as guidance to achieve sustainable development and preserve a future for posterity. <br />

According to UNICEF, "good health and well-being" is defined as "Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all, at all ages", including both physical 💪 and mental ❤ health. The latter, "gender equality", refers to "Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls." Our solution aspires to contribute to both aims shown above. Being a tool that aims to increase awareness of the menstrual cycle amongst female teenagers and provide reliable cycle predictions, it has the potential to make a difference in both goals. <br />
<br />
For starters, increasing education 📚 on periods amongst younger girls allows our cycle tracker app to improve physical well-being because improving understanding removes mystery and fear, as well as standardizes practices. Research has shown that in some developing countries, the needs of women during their periods are often neglected due to low education and limited income. In more extreme cases, having a period is considered taboo and should be concealed from the rest of the family. All of these are causes of poor menstrual hygiene and could lead to infections 💉 (e.g. urinary tract infection) and even affect one's ability to reproduce. Albeit an app will not increase one's income nor will it rectify those misconceptions immediately, it will be a concrete step towards an informed period, reducing the likelihood of illness, and gradually improving social status. <br />
In addition to physical health, mental well-being is another key component towards achieving "good health and well-being". Similar to the approach described above, by raising awareness of menstrual cycles, we expect to alleviate the internally originated sense of inferiority as well as reduce biases from others. On top of that, reliable cycle prediction ensures that periods can be anticipated, hence, mitigating stress regarding any potential embarrassments. Furthermore, we hope our app will create a sense of community among our users 👨‍👩‍👧‍👧, difficult times may not be so challenging when you are surrounded by your peers and friends. <br />
Gender equality is promoted through raising awareness as well. Note that menstrual cycle-related biases are not limited to developing countries, our app not only empowers female users with reliable tracking but also grants their partners an opportunity to learn and care for their spouse on a single platform. From a broader point of view, gender-related biases include confirmation bias (selective perception of information to confirm one's theory), availability heuristics (belief based on the availability of information in one's mind), and more. These biases could be the result of culture, personality, and upbringing. Although some aspects, such as personality, are relatively hard to change, raising awareness on our cycle tracker removes barriers to information, exposing one to new perspectives, thus enabling one to think more critically with more comprehensive knowledge, removing biases, and achieving gender equality.
