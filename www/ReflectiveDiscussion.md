title: Alignment with Sustainable Development Goals
---

üåè UNICEF has proposed 17 sustainable development goals that aim to avoid depleting resources at the expense of economic growth. Being at a junction of development when extreme weather is becoming more frequent and conflicts more intense, engineers must use these goals as guidance to achieve sustainable development and preserve a future for posterity. <br />

According to UNICEF, "good health and well-being" is defined as "Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all, at all ages", including both physical üí™ and mental ‚ù§ health. The latter, "gender equality", refers to "Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls." Our solution aspires to contribute to both aims shown above. Being a tool that aims to increase awareness of the menstrual cycle amongst female teenagers and provide reliable cycle predictions, it has the potential to make a difference in both goals. <br />
<br />
For starters, increasing education on periods amongst younger girls allows our cycle tracker app to improve physical well-being because improving understanding removes mystery and fear, as well as standardizes practices. Research has shown that in some developing countries, the needs of women during their periods are often neglected due to low education and limited income. In more extreme cases, having a period is considered taboo and should be concealed from the rest of the family. All of these are causes of poor menstrual hygiene and could lead to infections (e.g. urinary tract infection) and even affect one's ability to reproduce. Albeit an app will not increase one's income nor will it rectify those misconceptions immediately, it will be a concrete step towards an informed period, reducing the likelihood of illness, and gradually improving social status. In addition to physical health, mental well-being is another key component towards achieving "good health and well-being".
