This project looks to create an accessible, safe and informtive tool for young women to track and learn about their menstrual cycle.
We have created a website which you can input when your period occurs and can track when your next period will happen. 
The website consists of 5 pages; a home page with the calender with 3 months displaying on it, an information page to educate about the mentrual cycle, 
a diary page to record how you're feeling on each day of your cycle, a data page to store when you've inputed your start date and a settings page to change the 
layout of the website and to change the language of the website. All the data that's inputted on this website is stored locally on that browser in which only you 
have access to.
