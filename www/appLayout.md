### Home Page

On the Home page, 3 months will be visible, the current month, previous month and the next month. You can select which day of the cycle you think you're on
at the moment or probably what's easiest is selecting the date you know you started your first period on, change the Day of Cycle to display 1, and
click record. However, if you miss the start day of your period, you can change the Day of Cycle to whichever day it is and click record to update.
The default cycle length will be 28 days but if this isnt correct for you, the app will calculate your actual cycle length using an average of the last 3 months 
input information. The calender will display the predicted period dates with red dots so you know what date your next period will start. The calender will also
display your most fertile window using blue dots on those dates.
