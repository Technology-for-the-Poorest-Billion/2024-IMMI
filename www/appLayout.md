## App Layout
This will go through each of the pages on the website and what each page does.

### Home Page
On the Home page, 3 months will be visible, the current month, previous month and the next month.
You can select which day of the cycle you think you're onat the moment or probably what's easiest is selecting the date you know you started your first period on,
change the Day of Cycle to display 1, and click record.
However, if you miss the start day of your period, you can change the Day of Cycle to whichever day it is and click record to update.

</p>

The default cycle length will be 28 days but if this isnt correct for you, the app will calculate your actual cycle length using an average of the last 3 months 
input information.
Once you refresh, the calender will display the predicted fertile window with red dots and the date of the start of your next period in purple
so you know what date your next period will start. 
The calender will also display your past fertility window in yellow and past period dates in green.
