## Introduction
IMMI helps to manage and educate about your menstrual cycle by creating an informative website in which you can track your period.
We will run you through how to use the website, how the website was put together, and why this website is needed and a useful tool.

## Why the Website is needed
There's a lack of education about the menstrual cycle around the world with statistics showing that 40% of girls feel "confused and unprepared" when they 
first get their period. Current tools that provide assistance to help educate and track cycles exhibit negligence towards data privacy despite 79% of women
expressing concern. The IMMI Cycle Tracker has been developed with this in mind as well as a heavier emphasis on educating about the menstrual cycle.
